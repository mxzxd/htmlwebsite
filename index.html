<h1>What is Cyber Security?</h1>
<p>
<b>Cyber security</b> is defined as the <u>protection of information systems and networks from digital attacks</U>.This practise is used by both individuals and organisations to prevent unauthorised access to sensitive information or critical systems.
</p>
<h3> Why is this important? </h3>
<p>
Our smartphones, computers and the internet are fundamental parts of modern life. However, there is a risk to pay for carrying such devices that carry such important data. Cybercriminals target users personal information from names and addresses to credit card information and login details, to sell in underground digital marketplaces. The costs of cyber security breaches are rising with IBM reporting that in 2020, the average cost of a data breach was USD 3.86 million globally, with it being more than double the price at USD 8.64 million in the USA. This is because cyber attacks are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and complex.
