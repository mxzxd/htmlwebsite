<h2>Types of Cyber Threats </h2>
The most common type of cyber threats include:
<ul type="disc">
<li>Malware</li>
Malware refers to a form of malicious software that can cause damage or provide unauthorised access to a computer. There are many types of malware such as viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware and more.
<p>
<li>Ransomware</li>
Ransomware is another type of malware that locks the user out of their files, data or systems and demands a payment in return for their decryption, with the threat of leaking private information to the public or the destruction of files or software.
<p>
<li>Phishing / social engineering</li>
Phishing is a type of social engineering that manipulates users into allowing cyber criminals into sharing their own private information. This can be done through emails or text messages that appear to be legitimate asking for bank details or login information.
<p>
<li>Cryptojacking</li>
Cryptojacking or malicious cryptomining is an online threat that hides on a user's device and uses the machine's resources to 'mine' cryptocurrencies.
<p>
<li>Insider threats</li>
Insider threats are invisible to traditional security solutions as they refer to users who abuse their access permissions.
<p>
<li>Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks</li>
A DDoS attack is when a server, website or network is overloaded with traffic in attempts to crash it.
<p>
<li>Man-in-the-middle attacks</li>
Man-in-the-middle attacks are similar to eavesdropping in which a cybercriminal intercepts and relays messages between two parties to steal data.
<p>
</ul>
