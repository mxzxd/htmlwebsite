<h2>Personal Preventative Measures</h2>
A misconception that comes with cyber security is that it does not involve the individual. Surely, cybercriminals prefer to target organisations?
This is a risky way of thinking. Users who do not attempt to protect their data and information or educate themselves about the risks posed on the internet will find themselves vulnerable to cyber attacks.

<h3>Cyber Security Checklist</h3>
<ol>
<li>User education</li>
Human error is the leading cause of data breaches. Awareness is a simple yet effective solution.
<li>Update regularly</li>
Updates in programs and systems often include crucial security upgrades to protect against vulnerabilities and any bugs discovered in software.
<li>Security software</li>
A firewall is a straightforward and effectual gatekeeper between your computer and cyber attacks. Anti-virus protection is another example of security software to fight against malicious attacks as they filter and block malware.
<li>Password management</li>
Using simple and easily-guessed passwords such as 'password', 'qwerty' and birthdays make your accounts more susceptible to unauthorised access. Make passwords more difficult to guess by using upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbold.
